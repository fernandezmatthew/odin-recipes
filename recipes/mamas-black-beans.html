        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These Puerto-Rican style black beans were a staple for me growing up.
        My mom originally learned how to make these from her mother, but eventually
        mastered doing them her own way.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>2 large cans black beans</li>
           <li>1 oz. tocino (salt pork)</li>
           <li>1 tbsp. red wine vinegar</li>
           <li>2 bay leaves</li>
           <li>&frac12; onion</li>
           <li>8 cuchicha peppers</li>
           <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
           <li>1 handful cilantro</li>
           <li>1 handful parsley</li>
           <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
           <li>1 tbsp cumin</li>
           <li>1 tbsp black pepper</li>
           <li>water</li>
           <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>A key ingredient in these beans is the sofrito, which is a blend of veggies that gives the dish
        it's signature flavor. Make the sofrito before the rest of the dish.</p>
        <h3>Sofrito</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the onion, peppers, garlic, cilantro, parsley, and olive oil to a food processor and process
            until fine, but before it's particularly watery.<br>
            If you can't fit all of it at once, add a little of everything and process in steps.</li>
            <li>Store all your sofrito. It can be reused for months (don't think about the science).</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Black Beans</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the salt pork into lardons</li>
            <li>Set a medium to large pot to medium-high heat (7 out 10)</li>
            <li>Add the salt pork to the pot and cook until the fat renders out,
            and you get a little bit of browning.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium (5 out of 10) and add 3 tbsp. of the sofrito to the pot.</li>
            <li>Cook for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Add the red wine vinegar, pepper, and cumin.</li>
            <li>Let the vinegar cook for about 2 minutes, then add salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Add both cans of black beans, along with the fluid they're stored with.</li>
            <li>Fill the cans with water and add to the pot until the beans are completely submerged in liquid.</li>
            <li>Add bay leaves.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook for about an hour, checking in periodically, and adding water if it
            gets too dry.</li>
            <li>Give the beans a quarter mash.</li>
            <li>Salt to taste, turn off the heat, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
