        <h2>Description</h2>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1&frac12;-2 lbs. of bonesless skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 medium white/sweet onion</li>
            <li>1 large green bell pepper</li>
            <li>2 large celery sticks</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup of tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 lb. dried penne pasta</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. pepper</li>
            <li>1 gallon water</li>
            <li>3 tbsp. olive oil</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Pasta should be cooked at the same time as the Chicken and Sauce.</p>
        <p>Sauce should be prepped before chicken is done cooking, but not cooked
        until after the chicken is done.</p>
        <h3>Pasta</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put water in medium to large pot set to the highest heat</li>
            <li>Add a <em>generous</em> amount of salt. More than you think.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, add pasta to pot.</li>
            <li>Stir immediately, then once every 5 minutes until cooked</li>
            <li>Check you pasta brand's box for estimated cooking time. Once that
                time has passed, take a bite of a noodle to see if it's done.</li>
            <li>Strain the pasta and keep it to the side</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Chicken</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut chicken into bite size chunks.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken in a bowl along with 1 tbsp. salt and all cajun seasoning.</li>
            <li>Mix until seasoning is evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Set a large saute pan on medium-high heat (7 out of 10) and add 1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
            <li>Once pan is at about 200&deg;C, add the chicken in, evenly spreading on the surface
                of the pan.</li>
            <li>After about 3&frac12; minutes, flip all the chicken pieces.</li>
            <li>After another 3 minutes, taste to ensure cookness, and remove from pan into a bowl.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
