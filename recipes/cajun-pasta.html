            <li>Stir immediately, then once every 5 minutes until cooked</li>
            <li>Check you pasta brand's box for estimated cooking time. Once that
                time has passed, take a bite of a noodle to see if it's done.</li>
            <li>Strain the pasta and keep it to the side.</li>

                of the pan.</li>
            <li>After about 3&frac12; minutes, flip all the chicken pieces.</li>
