        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This pasta bolognese is inspired by a traditional italian recipe, but with
        some of my own modifications. <em>Always</em> use papardelle.</p><hr>

            <li>1 medium white/sweet onion</li>
            <li>2 large celery sticks</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Pasta should be cooked at the same time as the Meat Sauce.</p><hr>
        <h3>Pasta</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put water in medium to large pot and set to the highest heat.</li>
            <li>Add a <em>generous</em> amount of salt. More than you think.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, add pasta to pot.</li>
            <li>Stir immediately, then once every minute until cooked</li>
            <li>Check you pasta brand's bag for estimated cooking time. Once that
                time has passed, take a bite of a noodle to see if it's done.</li>
            <li>Strain the pasta and keep it to the side.</li>
        </ol><hr>
        <h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop onions, celery, and carrots into a small dice.</li>
            <li>Thinly mince the garlic.</li>
            <li>Cut bacon into thin lardons</li>
            <li>Set a medium to large pot to medium-high heat (7 out 10)</li>
            <li>Add the bacon to the pot and cook until the fat renders out,
            and you get a little bit of browning.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium (5 out of 10) and add your chopped veggies (not the garlic yet).</li>
            <li>Keep mixing periodically for about 10 minutes, making sure nothing burns.<br>
            *Raise heat if the pot is too quiet.*</li>
            <li>Add the beef and pork to the pot.</li>
            <li>Season with pepper, oregano, and a generous amount of salt.</li>
            <li>Raise heat to medium-high (7 outn of 10)</li>
            <li>After the meat browns, add the glass of white wine.</li>
            <li>Once the alcohol is cooked out (about 3 minutes), add tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Add water until beef is completely submerged in liquid</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook for about 1-1&frac12; hours, checking in periodically,
            and adding water if it gets too dry.</li>
            <li>Make sure the sauce isn't watery, then add the cream.</li>
        </ol><hr>
        <h3>Final Product</h3>
        <p>Finally, mix in your cooked pasta and enjoy!</p><hr>
