Basic Recipe Website

BEFORE START
Website should consist of main index page and have links to a few recipes.

AFTER FINISHING HTML
Website consists of three of my favorite dishes to cook. Addition of <hr> tags
makes it look pretty good considering the lack of css.
All of the recipes are fairly accurate, and I would emplore anyone to try them out
for themselves!
